# Fun Facts App

A simple, interactive web application that displays random fun facts about a person. This project demonstrates basic web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Random fact generation with one-click updates
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing
- Clean, modern interface with smooth animations
- Customizable fact collection

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `style.css` - Styling and layout
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality for random fact generation

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Ensure all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## Customization

To personalize the app with your own facts:
1. Open `script.js`
2. Locate the `funFacts` array
3. Replace the existing facts with your own personal facts
4. Save the file

Example:
```javascript
const funFacts = [
    "I completed the Half Dome hike at Yosemite National Park in 2023",
    "I've read 24 books in the past year, mostly science fiction",
    // Add more facts here
];
